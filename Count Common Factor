  This problem is asked in one of the HackerEarth contests.
  Problem Statement: Little Robert likes mathematics. Today his teacher has 
  given him two integers and asked him to find out how many integers 
  can divide both the numbers. Would you like to help him in completing 
  his school assignment?

//




let a = prompt("Enter  Your first  number ");
let b = prompt("Enter Your second Number");



let i,j,count =0;

for(i=1,j=1;i <= a,j<= b; i++,j++){
    
    if(a%i==0 && b%j ==0){
        count = count +1;
    }
}

println(count);
